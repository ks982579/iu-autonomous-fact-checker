      "21) LONDON (Reuters) - British Prime Minster Theresa May published on Friday a code of conduct for all her lawmakers and party officials to follow, the latest step in her response to growing allegations of improper conduct in parliament. Britain s parliament is the latest institution to become embroiled in a sex scandal after abuse allegations against Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein prompted thousands of women and men to share stories about improper behavior. On Wednesday, defense minister Michael Fallon resigned saying his past conduct had fallen below the required standard, costing May a trusted ally in a fragile minority government and underlining her political vulnerability to further allegations. On Friday, she set out the code of conduct on the Conservative Party website, detailing standards expected of elected and appointed party members, the procedure for breaches of those standards and the party s definitions of discrimination, harassment, sexual harassment and bullying.  This code sets out for the first time in one place the procedure which the party uses in dealing with complaints, along with a number of additional measures which we have introduced in light of recent allegations,  May said in a letter to the speaker of parliament s lower chamber.    In the letter, May said parliament also needed to take more responsibility for protecting workers within the system, repeating her call for a common, transparent and independent grievance procedure for all at Westminster. May said she would meet other party leaders on Monday to discuss a separate proposal for a non-political way to handle complaints in parliament. \n",

We are a movement of young people who resists the left liberal indoctrination!We can no longer remain silent! We see how the values and cultural decline progresses, as our home and our traditions are increasingly destroyed and how the freedom of political correctness gives way.We are united by fate to be the last generation that can turn things around again! What unites us is the self-knowledge to be the phalanx, which it needs to take action against the self-destructive, prevailing multicultural ideology that drives the mass immigration and Islamization, and thus the ultimate disappearance of thousands of years old family of nations and cultural tradition called Europe.We stand together in our quest to protect our homeland, the restoration of freedom and sovereignty of our country and fight for the preservation of our ethno cultural identity!But with idealism alone this fight is not to lead! Courage, dedication and sacrifice will not suffice to stand up as a young person against the predominant players in the debt pride and multicultural madness for a livable Germany. We need your support! \n",

Dear Ivanka, we need to talk about your dad,  the group s website reads. Racism, anti-Semitism, misogyny, and homophobia are not acceptable anywhere least of all in the White House. Steve Bannon has no place in the White House. Jeff Sessions has no place in the White House. Talk of a Muslim registry has no place in the White House. Hate has no place in the White House. We refuse to  wait and see . We look to you as the voice of reason. Other artists, many of whom have pieces in Ivanka s lavish apartment, have also chimed in on the issue.

How deaf can they be to the sound of angry fans who want teams to stand with hand over heart for our flag and national anthem.The left is busy conflating the NFL protest with their rage over the election of Trump They ve turned Trump s comments into a  dog whistle  of racism Remember when Trump called the players  son s of b*tches ? Well, that s now been interpreted by the eternal victims in the black community as a  dog whistle  of racism. The problem is that anyone with half a brain knows there are white players too but it s just an inconvenient truth to the left. This is where they ve wanted the argument to go because it benefits the left to make Trump out to be a racist.Of course, anyone with a speck of common sense knows President Trump wants ALL Americans to come together to stand for the anthem period! Nothing to it but that Zero racism!The video below is a great example of how the black activists and left are in a rage.

      "140) SOFIA (Reuters) - Couples lining up to face each other are given 30 seconds to chat before moving on - in a version of speed dating that, rather than sparking romance, aims to promote understanding and integration for new immigrants. At a social center in the Bulgarian capital Sofia, the locals stand on one side, the immigrants - many refugees from Syria, Afghanistan and other war-torn countries - face them.  The quick-fire conversations - in which participants have just seconds to share their dreams and stories of love, pain and family - are aimed at starting a dialogue between two communities that in normal daily life rarely speak to each other on an equal footing.  It s so good to have an event like this, especially for refugees,  said Rodi Naamo, a 26-year-old Syrian Kurd who arrived in Bulgaria in 2015, when hundreds of thousands of migrants passed through the Balkans en route to Germany and northern Europe.  Bulgarians also appreciated the speedy encounters, as well as the Middle Eastern food and traditional Afghan dances afterwards.  I really enjoyed it, it helped me overcome prejudices,  said Milka Bocheva, a Bulgarian who runs an online business.  They (the refugees) are just people like us, we gave such similar answers.  Bulgaria stands out in the region for its significant Muslim minority, some 12 percent among 7.1 million mainly Orthodox Christians - a legacy of its history as part of the Ottoman Empire.  Despite that, large parts of the population are concerned about the influx of asylum-seekers and migrants.  Naamo, who returned to Bulgaria after a short spell in Germany, to work in a call center, believes opinions are starting to change.  I decided to stay here, this is my country. I ll bring my family here,  he said.   \n",

She s a tough business woman who s proud to have come to America as an immigrant and earned her citizenship the LEGAL way. Watch her no-nonsense interview here with leftist MSNBC hack host, Mika Brzezinski, who does everything in her power to provoke her and condemn her husband: I followed the law,  Trump said in an interview with Mika Brzezinski aired Wednesday on MSNBC s  Morning Joe,  in discussing the hoops she had to jump through in order to become a citizen of the United States.  I never thought to stay here without papers. I had a visa, I traveled every few months back to the country to Slovenia to stamp the visa. I came back, I applied for the green card, I applied for the citizenship later on after many years of green card. So I went by system, I went by the law. And you should do that, you should not just say let me stay here and whatever happens, happens. Trump, who immigrated to the United States from Slovenia in 1996, said that she and her husband are  prepared  for people to call him names for expressing his viewpoints.  I m a full-time mom, and I love it. So, I decided not to be in the campaign so much, but I support my husband 100 percent,  she said of her role in the campaign itself. We have thick skin, and we know that people will judge him and people will call names. They don t give him enough credit. From June that he announced, they don t give him enough credit,  she said, leading Brzezinski to ask her what she thought about people who felt he insulted Mexicans with his comments that the country is sending rapists and murderers across the border in his announcement speech.

      "196) Trump spoke to his supporters at a rally in Cleveland, Ohio, on Saturday. As one would expect from Trump, he s not about to sit back and allow Bernie Sanders supporters and Black Lives Matter terrorists hijack his rallies. After addresseding the violent protesters in Chicago, he reinacted Bernie Sanders cowardly reaction when two female Black Lives Matter terrorists took over the mic while at the start of his rally in Seattle.  He called Bernie Sanders a  communist  and identified his supporters as  troublemakers.  Watch here:Watch here to see how Bernie Sanders reacted to the aggressive and disrespectful, thuggish behavior of two female representatives from the Black Lives Matter terror group. What is even more stunning is how the man who wants to be the leader of the free world stands in a corner like a dutiful Leftist allowing these two women to completely hijack a rally his people orgnaized. If Bernie can t control two unarmed, female domestic terrorists, how could anyone expect he could defend America against one of our enemies? This video is so embarrassing, it should be played over and over again as a reminder of the pacifist, communist who wants to be America s next President:Not everyone at the Bernie Sanders rally was down with the hateful, divisive Black Lives Matter terror representative s message;\n",

      "259) LONDON (Reuters) - Britain s foreign minister Boris Johnson said he was not going to resign, when questioned on Tuesday following reports that he could quit before the weekend if his Brexit demands were not met by Prime Minister Theresa May. May is due to make a speech on Brexit on Friday and the Daily Telegraph newspaper reported that close friends of Johnson believe he will have no choice but to walk away if she advocates permanently paying for access to the EU s single market. Speaking in New York, Johnson was asked by reporters if he planned to resign in footage aired by Sky News.  No ... of course not, we re going to deliver a fantastic Brexit,  he said.  We re working together, and the key thing is to make sure Britain can take advantage of the opportunities that Brexit provides.  May later backed Johnson in an interview with Sky News.  Boris is doing good work as Foreign Secretary,  she said, according to a Tweet by Sky News reporter Beth Rigby.  May also said she was confident of getting her whole senior team of ministers to back her Brexit strategy, which she is due to lay out at a specially convened cabinet meeting on Thursday before making her Brexit speech in Florence on Friday. \n",

      "373) There are seldom those moments in life that seem so poetic, but the people sharing the space where the Republican congressional retreat is being held is pretty much the perfect metaphor for the embodiment of the GOP party platform.It s all happening at the Marriott Hotel at the Baltimore Harbor, and right down the hall from where Republicans are trying to put together strategies for the coming year   that is where the Mid-Atlantic Monument Builders  Association is holding their annual summit. And within the room where the Monument Builders are meeting, there is a huge sampling of headstones.How is this the perfect metaphor for the Republican party? So glad you asked.The GOP has spent nearly the past thirty years trying to make sure people have a rougher go at life than they could if they had a government that actually worked in their best interest. Instead of fighting for people to have greater access to health care, they ve been mercilessly fighting against broadened access and affordable coverage. They ve also been trying for decades to privatize social security instead of strengthen our existing government pension program that guarantees income for senior citizens who worked hard all their lives. They d prefer a system that relied on an unsteady market where people could, quite literally, lose everything. The GOP has also consistently tried to make it harder for low-income citizens to have access to Medicaid and food assistance programs. Not to mention the GOP s love for war and lust for sending American lives to die for causes still unknown.So, to see gravestones just steps away from where congressional Republicans are talking about ideas is absolutely perfect. Their ideas and plans for the people of this nation would lead to the early demise of several citizens. Kudos to whoever chose that space to hold the event, it s very telling of GOP policy.

I know you ll miss me,  he joked to reporters after signing a bill preserving wilderness land in Idaho.With no official appearances on the schedule, Obama, Michelle and their youngest daughter Sasha will spend the time away from Washington dabbling in their usual vacation activities: leisurely rounds of golf, beach outings, hikes and bike rides, and dinner at some of the island s top restaurants.The property in Chilmark, on the western part of the island, includes a dual basketball and tennis court.A cluster of top aides will also enjoy a 17-day stay on the island, known as a summer hangout for the wealthy, to update the president as developments warrant.Via: UK Daily Mail \n",

In a letter drafted in French which was hung on the Handschoenmarkt, the mayor of Antwerp was threatened with execution if he did not convert to Islam. How serious the threat should be taken remains to be seen, said De Wever in The News on VTM. La Libre also reported on the threat: Des nouvelles menaces de mort ont  t  prof r es   l encontre du pr sident de la N-VA Bart De Wever.

This was ignored for years. This wound became apparent now with [the current developments in] Syria and will fester for a long time before we will get rid of it,  de Wever said.

      "730) In a fraught moment of political protest across the country, the live mic at televised award shows has become a potent weapon.As such, Grammy Awards producer Ken Ehrlich has a message for those who will take the stage on Sunday s ceremony: Bring it on.Ehrlich has no reservations about political messages or anti-President Trump statements flying during CBS  three and a half hour Grammycast. Artists expressing passionate opinions about real-life issues are the stuff of memorable moments, he said. One of the tenets of our show is artistic freedom, and over the years we ve shown we do believe in it,  Ehrlich told Variety.  How many more times do we need to hear  I d like to thank my publicist, my agent, my wife and kids.  The great acceptance speeches are ones that have a point of view and are more personal. The only guidelines on speech that Ehrlich has to keep an eye (and ear) on is profanity, given the potential for CBS to be hit with FCC fines if F-bombs fly before 10 p.m. But almost everything else is fair game. One of the things I ve learned from working with artists for 40 years is that they are deep-thinking, vital individuals who have interests that cover a broad cover a broad spectrum of subjects and passions,  he said.  We should certainly allow for it on the broadcast. Ehrlich notes that the Grammy Awards as an institution has addressed issues of social justice and equality on the telecast in recent years.  NYP\n",

      "761) Last night, Donald Trump gave a speech in Wisconsin that was meant to appeal to people of color   a voting bracket that the Republican nominee has epically failed in trying to get on board with his campaign and policies.Trump must have been well aware that currently, only 1% of African Americans are supporting him and the fact that there is unrest and riots happening in Milwaukee   you can always count on The Donald to find an opportunity to make himself look good and exploit tragedy.Here s a clip of the speech Trump gave, which is a blatant, pathetic attempt to try and win over African American voters by a man who once called a black man in the crowd  My African American.  Let s see if he can make them forget that detail:So, did it work? Judging from these responses on Twitter, no one is being fooled by Trump s thinly veiled attempt to simply gain more support. Here s what people really thought of Trump s speech:TwitterTwitterTwitterMany people noticed how strange it was that Trump would choose Wisconsin and a mostly-white crowd to deliver a speech to black voters   especially when there were areas of America that needed to hear this much more. Some even called Trump  gutless.

This compilation of blatant blocking for Hillary is beyond embarrassing and these  journalists  should be serving time for journalistic malpractice.We all know the mainstream media is guilty of supporter the Democrat candidate for President in almost every election for decades, the question is:  Are we going to allow them to define the narrative and cover for a criminal while destroying the reputation of Trump, who is truly the only ally we have against this corrupt media, or are we going to stand up and shout,  NO MORE! ? A few examples of journalistic malpractice: We have chosen to cut off that microphone. Let me be clear here, obviously the majority of Donald Trump supporters are not African American, I don t know how many African Americans were in that building.

When President Donald Trump and German Chancellor Angela Merkel finally get together on Friday, the leaders of the West s two most powerful countries are sure to come off more like an odd couple than two close allies chewing over plans for some joint enterprise. And for good reason. Merkel and Trump are not only polar opposites as people, but they share little in terms of international outlook.Their styles reflect their vastly different backgrounds. Merkel, Germany s first and only female chancellor, was raised by a pastor in communist East Germany, where she earned a doctorate in physical chemistry. Although she is the longest-serving and most powerful leader in Europe, she is unfailingly modest, competent and consensus-oriented. Trump s all-about-me mentality, Queens upbringing and brash, tabloid-and-reality-TV personality couldn t be more different. Could one even imagine the outrage if a piece like this was published about Barack Obama within his first 60 days in office? The mentality of the unhinged left is on display for every American to see and if they keep this up, even for a few more months, they will never win another election.

      "880) Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau participated in a forum on Thursday, which was hosted by the New York Times, to discuss current relations between Canada and the United States. Trudeau was as suave as ever for the most part and tried hard to play down the fact that Donald Trump is a raving f*cking lunatic. However, when the conversation turned to Trump s tweets, he accidentally pointed out what an irresponsible child the current  President  actually is.Trudeau was asked if he has his phone set to notify him when Trump sends out a tweet, like many of us do. Without even trying, the Prime Minister s response made Trump look like a damn fool. There s no question that the way the President chooses to speak directly to people through social media is a new wrinkle in international diplomacy,  Trudeau replied. He explained that deciphering how serious to take any given tweet of Trump s is important so that Canada can respond  without reacting to a similar level. The interviewers continued to press Trudeau on the matter, asking him if he is  in bed, like the rest of us, looking at Twitter at night?  And that is when it came. He made Trump look like an absolute moron simply by doing his job and not being a Twitter-obsessed narcissist. No, I tend to focus on the things I need to do, on my job,  Trudeau said, causing the audience to burst into laughter. Realizing that he had just unintentionally wiped the floor with Trump, he added, If I get woken up at night, it better be for something more important than a tweet.  This just caused the crowd to laugh even harder.  By anyone!  he said as an afterthought, but the everyone in the room was still howling with laughter.You can watch a video of this exchange below and you can watch Trudeau s entire interview here:Featured image via Win McNamee/Getty Images\n",
      "888) Not too many people had heard of Bernie Sanders until recently. Although a senator, Sanders doesn t come from a famous political family, nor is he a party favorite. However, Sanders has taken the country by storm and ignited an energy and excitement for the political process not seen in decades. That s because Sanders  ideas have hit home for many people. His new campaign ad for the presidency sums up his policies in such an impassioned way that it will leave you in tears. The ad begins with the statement: What does it mean to lead a moral life? When we talk about morality, and when we talk about hope, we have to understand that there is no justice when so few have so much and so many have so little. There is no justice when the top 1/10th% owns almost as much wealth as the bottom 90%. Sanders also touches on the fact that  millions of people are working long hours  but unable to feed their children, and the fact that the United States today has the highest rate of childhood poverty of any country in the developed world. Instead, Sanders says we use our money for the wrong reasons: How can we talk about morality and justice when we turn our backs on the children of our country? We have in this country sufficient amounts of money to put more people in jail than any other country on earth but apparently we do not have enough money to provide jobs and education to our young people. The touching four minute ad continues to hit on topics vital to the interests of millions of Americans including healthcare  to all people as a right. All of the people, the poor and the wretched have a right to go to the doctor when they are sick. Bernie Sanders  ideas resonate with many Americans because he s been able to eloquently bring to light issues that the majority of politicians lack the courage in tackling.  He s the most genuine presidential candidate in generations.Watch video here:[youtube {{URL}} image via video screenshot.\n",

      "908) The Walt Disney Company   the same group that s so woke, they once apologized for drawing a fat cartoon that made race-baiters mad   has taken it upon themselves to teach your kids about LGBT rights by featuring their first on-screen gay character.According to this, Disney plans to have one of the main characters on their popular tween show Andi Mack come out as  gay  in this week s episode. Oh   and it s a 13-year-old boy who s got feelings for the main character s crush.Of course, the character s coming out as gay doesn t to do with moving the plotline forward so much as it pushes the pro-LBGT agenda the media are determined to cram down your throat   or, if that fails, your kid s. Andi Mack is a story about  tweens  figuring out who they are,  said Disney Channel in a statement.  (Creator) Terri Minsky, the cast and everyone involved in the show takes great care in ensuring that it s appropriate for all audiences and sends a powerful message about inclusion and respect for humanity. Producers say the  coming out  scene will have the barely-a-teenager telling a friend about his feelings for a boy at school. His friend will tell him it s A-O.K. and perfectly natural for guys to like guys, because Disney s all about creating a brainwashing  supportive  atmosphere. The company added they consulted with several outside advocacy groups to make sure the scene was  age-appropriate  and sufficiently inclusive, including gay activist groups GLAAD and PFLAG, along with the National Campaign to Prevent Teen and Unplanned Pregnancy and Common Sense Media.Groups that would ve likely had a different opinion about teaching pre-pubescent elementary school kids the importance of being gay didn t make the list.According to ratings data, the median age of Andi Mack s viewers is 10. In fact, the show is the Disney channel s No. 1-rated program among kids six-14. Because nothing says  inclusivity  like teaching six-year-olds about being gay, whether their parents like it or not.

Well the 24-year-old has done it again.Lahren was being interviewed at Politicon by liberal comedian Chelsea Handler on Saturday, an event that was originally publicized as a  debate,  only to later be downplayed by Handler as an interview in an effort to get to understand the viewpoints of people that don t share her political ideology. People such as Tomi Lahren.The pair struggled to find any common ground during the first several minutes of the interview and then the topic turned to healthcare. When Handler asked Lahren if she had health insurance, she replied,  Luckily, I am 24, so I am still on my parents  plan  a line that drew loud boos from the crowd, but Handler still defended her by telling the audience to stop, she is being honest.  Despite Handler taking the high road, Lahren went on to say that Obamacare is in a  death spiral. Being able to stay on your parents  plan until the age of 26 is a major aspect of the current healthcare legislation and also one of the beneficial facets that critics of the Affordable Care Act tend to overlook, instead opting to chastise other factors such as the individual mandate to buy insurance.The outspoken Lahren has been a controversial figure in the realm of political commentary, having joined the pro-Donald Trump group Great American Alliance in May after she was suspended from hosting her own show, Tomi, on TheBlaze in March when she expressed her belief that women should have legal access to abortion, a view rarely shared by her fellow conservatives.Watch a portion of Handler s interview with Lahren here:Featured image via Joshua Blanchard/Getty Images for Politicon)\n",

      "1026) Christmas the perfect time to pander to Muslims There is a reason his mother never let him be King. During a recent radio broadcast, Charles, Britain s Prince of Wales, told his listeners that Christians should give thoughts to the prophet Mohammed during this Christmas season.Clip via The Telegraph Normally at Christmas, we think of the Birth of our Lord Jesus Christ,  he said on Radio 4 s  Thoughts for the Day.   I wonder though if this year we might remember how the story of the nativity unfolds, with the fleeing of the holy family to escape violent persecution. The crown prince then likened that event to Mohammed traveling to Medina in search of converts. And we might also remember that when the prophet Muhammad migrated from Mecca to Medina he was seeking the freedom for himself and his followers to worship. Prince Charles then claimed that all religious groups want the same thing   the ability to live and worship in peace and to allow others to do the same. Whichever religious path we follow, the destination is the same   to value and respect the other person, accepting their right to live out their peaceful response to the love of God,  he said.The Prince of Wales then appeared to go after both president-elect Donald Trump s populist message as well as Great Britain s departure from the European Union based, in part, on the influx of immigrants from Middle Eastern Countries. We are now seeing the rise of many populist groups across the world that are increasingly aggressive towards those who adhere to a minority faith. All of this has deeply disturbing echoes of the dark days of the 1930s,  he said.   BPR \n",

      "1122) There was plenty of crazy material from the Republicans this week and in order to cover as much of their embarrassing antics as possible, NBC s Saturday Night Live broke with their usual format and jammed four openings on their show last night. The result was a series of hilarious and stinging skits.It all began with Beck Bennett as Jake Tapper when he hosted the week-in-review montage which highlighted Darrell Hammond as Donald Trump telling the world how great he his with a bewildered looking Chris Christie, played by Bobby Moynihan, staring in the background. Hammond-as-Trump said: I really am running the best campaign, aren t I? The media s saying they haven t seen anything like this, not since Germany in the 1930s. I mean, everyone loves me: racists, ugly racists, people who didn t know they were racist. Then it was the hilarious Kate McKinnon playing Hillary Clinton giving a victory speech for her post-Super Tuesday victory: Thank you for trusting that I, Hillary Clinton, can bring this country together. Just like I brought these ten black people and one Muslim person together behind me tonight for this speech. Then it was Bennett-as-Tapper interviewing Ted Cruz, played by Taran Killam, but not before a warning for the audience that they were about to see Ted Cruz s  whole face.  Asked about Thursday s GOP debate, Killam-as-Cruz said: The debate was so much fun. I talked policy, I laid out my plan for America, and right at the end I ate a tiny, little white booger off my lip. Then finally Mitt Romney, played by Jason Sudeikis, joined Bennet-as-Tapper to discuss Donald Trump: For the last nine months, I ve sat down and watched Donald Trump say something every day that was either racist or sexist. And we in the GOP  we do not say racist and sexist things; we imply them subtly over decades and decades of policy. Watch the clip here:Featured image via screenshot\n",
      "1137) New York City begs to differ Of course, this is just another way of Obama saying,  Screw Trump and screw America, we re building Muslim communities in your hometowns and communities with or without your permission. In an official statement on the eve of Ramadan, an Islamic holy month, Barack Obama said the United States would continue to welcome Muslim refugees despite  voices that seek to divide us. I stand firmly with Muslim American communities in rejection of the voices that seek to divide us or limit our religious freedoms or civil rights,  he said in the statement.  I stand committed to safeguarding the civil rights of all Americans no matter their religion or appearance. Obama s speech regarding Ramadan, the monthlong holiday observed by Muslims through fasting during daylight hours, did not mention Donald Trump by name, but clearly seemed to be directed towards the Republican nominee. Here in the United States, we are blessed with Muslim communities as diverse as our nation itself. There are those whose heritage can be traced back to the very beginning of our nation, as well as those who have only just arrived,  he said. Via: Townhall \n",

We hold true to our We Care philosophy   our responsibilities extend beyond the workplace and into our communities.Ever since the announcement, the company s Facebook page has blown up with support, with hundreds, possibly thousands, of people now looking for a new home loan. Luckily, Home Point Financial is licensed in 46 states.This is a perfect example to set for today s youth (and apparently adults): be very careful about what you post on social media, you never know who may be watching or what your company may think.Thankfully, Home Point Financial doesn t tolerate racism and sheer disrespect for our nation s First Lady.Conservative s love to accuse Democrats of playing the race card. Yet time and time again, they are the ones who bring up the Obama s race and make racially charged statements   like calling them monkeys, gorillas, Africans, Panthers, the list goes on and on.The company should scrutinize Greenwood s cases, to find if there was ever any racial discrimination in her loan process. Judging by her charge against Michelle Obama, it wouldn t be far-fetched that she completely undermined black Americans trying to get a home.Kudos to the company for stamping out hate. Let this be a lesson to conservatives and Trump supporters alike that racism is no longer being tolerated.Featured image via Joe Readle/Getty Images\n",

Unlike most of the other candidates, he actually talks about the issues and in addition, he has sound and rational solutions to problems.His appealing straightforwardness and candor was all on display as he made an  appearance  on Seinfeld.

      "1269) DELBRUECK, Germany (Reuters) - Turks can safely come to Germany, Chancellor Angela Merkel said on Sunday, dismissing a warning from Ankara that its citizens should take care when traveling there due to what it said was an increase in anti-Turkish sentiment. Tensions between Berlin and Ankara have been bubbling for months and Turkey s warning on Saturday came after Germany s foreign ministry said on Tuesday Germans traveling to Turkey risked arbitrary detention even in tourist areas.  I want to say very clearly that all Turkish citizens can travel here,  Merkel said in the northwestern German town of Delbrueck during a campaign event ahead of a Sept. 24 election.  No journalists get arrested here and no journalists get put in custody. Freedom of opinion and the rule of law prevail here and we re proud of that,  Merkel said. She pointed to German-Turkish journalist Deniz Yucel, who has been detained in Turkey for more than 200 days. He is one of 12 German citizens now in Turkish detention on political charges, four of them holding dual citizenship.  We think there s no justification at all for him being in prison and the same applies to at least 11 other Germans,  Merkel said. Merkel, who infuriated the Turkish government last weekend by saying she would seek an end to Turkey s membership talks with the European Union, is expected to win a fourth term in the upcoming election. Polls give her conservatives a double-digit percentage lead over their rival Social Democrats (SPD).     \n",

He was very touched by the fact we called him. The CBC has not corrected the lie! Please send feedback (it took me a minute to do so) to them. Tell them to correct the lie they told.NOT TRUE!The report by the CBC didn t tell the whole story. The Texas SOS released a statement with a rebuke to the media reports. CBC confirmed that they had misreported the interview. Contrary to what has been reported in the media, Secretary Pablos did not decline the minister s offer, but instead made sure Quebec made contact with the proper Texas state agency,  a spokeswoman said.  The Quebec Government s office in Houston is in constant contact with local authorities and is arranging for emergency supplies to be shipped shortly.

Their cash cow might be at risk The president of the teachers union makes a six figure income! What s wrong with Trump trying to FINALLY focus on the kids? Trump visited St. Andrew Catholic School in Orlando, dropping in on a fourth-grade classroom and shaking hands with students who said they were learning about the history of Florida. When one girl said she wanted to own her own business, he said with a smile that she s  gonna make a lot of money. But don t run for politics.  The president, who was joined by his new education secretary Betsy DeVos, a longtime charter schools advocate, described St. Andrew as  one of the many parochial schools dedicated to educating disadvantaged children. Education is the civil rights issue of our time,  said Trump, repeating a line from his address to Congress this week. Teachers unions were quick to criticize the visit, saying it showed hostility by Trump toward public schools and an intention to turn education into a profit-making industry. Trump said he would ask lawmakers to pass a bill that would fund school choice for disadvantaged young people, including minority children. He did not offer any details.Read more: big story\n",

      "1472) VIENNA (Reuters) - Austria s conservatives and far-right Freedom Party (FPO) could complete coalition talks as soon as Friday evening and be sworn in on Monday, officials from both parties said. A deal between the center-right People s Party (OVP) led by 31-year-old Sebastian Kurz and the anti-immigration Freedom Party would mark a major victory for a European far-right party after a flurry of elections this year.  We are putting effort into this and we would be happy if it was possible to announce an agreement to you today, but I cannot promise it yet,  said Gernot Bluemel, a close Kurz ally and leader of the conservatives in Vienna.  We hope that we can properly conclude (the last issues) over the course of today. If you want to compare it to a skiing race, we are now doing the last turns before the finish line... I am in good spirits.  Conservative Interior Minister Wolfgang Sobotka, whom local media and a source close to the coalition talks have named as a candidate for finance minister, told ORF radio  a new government will be sworn in on Monday . An FPO source confirmed the envisaged timing for an agreement and swearing-in ceremony, adding a news conference with Kurz and Freedom Party leader Heinz-Christian Strache was planned for 1800 Vienna time (1700 GMT) on Friday. The Freedom Party last entered government in 2000, triggering European sanctions against Austria. Such a step has not been flagged this time around, with many European countries having shifted to the political right. Kurz, whose party won just over 31 percent in October s parliamentary elections, is all but certain to become chancellor with Strache   whose FPO got 26 percent for third place after the Social Democrats   as his deputy. Freedom Party officials are set to fill major ministries, including the interior, foreign, defense, health and social affairs and infrastructure portfolios. This list has been neither confirmed nor denied by party officials. \n",

The election to pick a new regional governor on the Mediterranean island is widely seen as a test of trends across Italy ahead of parliamentary elections due by next May. RAI state television said Nello Musumeci, backed by center-right parties, including former Prime Minister Berlusconi s Forza Italia (Go Italy!), would win between 35 percent and 39 percent of the vote. The 5-Star s Giancarlo Cancelleri was seen taking between 33-37 percent. Another exit poll for private broadcaster La 7 put Musumeci on 36-40 percent and Cancelleri on 34-38 percent. The center-left s candidate Fabrizio Micari, backed by the ruling Democratic Party, was seen almost 20 points behind the frontrunner in both polls, followed by Claudio Fava, the candidate of a cluster of left-wing parties. The vote count will not begin until Monday at 8 a.m (0700 GMT) with the full result expected later that day. \n",

Miranda breaks into laughter as the President kicks off the rap by looking sternly into the camera and saying: This some serious business right here  in his best ghetto voice.Obama holds up cue cards while Miranda then freestyle raps on whatever subject comes up. The cards include Constitution, POTUS, Obamacare, the Federalist papers (ouch!), the Obama family dogs Sunny and Bo, NASA, carbon footprint, congress, innovation, SCOTUS, and immigrants   to which Miranda riffs:  we get the job done! The President smiled widely at the end of the footage, saying:The post immediately of course, did go viral.

      "1822) The self proclaimed  feminist  apparently has no problem with using physical force against a woman who is part of a party that opposes his radical ideology Apparently, he forgot about his  softer side  when he elbowed NDP MP Ruth Ellen Brousseau in the chest Following the fracas on the floor of the House of Commons Wednesday night, opposition members of Parliament have taken turns scolding Justin Trudeau for his behaviour, with some even suggesting that the prime minister might be guilty of a crime.Justin Trudeau elbows his way into a bad dayJustin Trudeau apologizes for  failing to live up to a higher standard NDP MP Niki Ashton said that  physical violence  had taken place in the House and that  people would call what happened here assault.  Conservative MP and deputy justice critic Michael Cooper suggested that Trudeau s physical encounters with two MPs could be defined as  criminal assault.  And Tory MP Mark Warawa tweeted that Trudeau was guilty of  physical assault.  And technically speaking, they might have a point.Ahead of a vote to limit debate on the government s doctor-assisted dying bill, Trudeau walked across the aisle and took Conservative Party whip Gord Brown by the arm while inadvertently elbowing NDP MP Ruth Ellen Brosseau in the chest. Trudeau has apologized repeatedly for the incident and said his behaviour was  unacceptable. Assault definition is broadBut the act of taking Brown by the arm and ushering him to his seat,  in the most technical sense   probably meets all the requirements for assault,  said Toronto lawyer Daniel Lerner, who was a former Ontario Crown prosecutor. The basic definition of an assault is if a person intentionally uses force on another person without their consent. (Brown said he told the prime minister to let go of him.)But that definition is broad and  can capture quite a lot,  Lerner said.Via: CBC \n",

      "1864) OOSTKAMP, Belgium (Reuters) - Catalonia s former leader challenged Spain and the European Union to respect the result of Catalan regional elections in December, saying Madrid would have to end direct rule if separatists win. Speaking from Belgium where he fled earlier this month, Carles Puigdemont said the vote was the most important in Catalonia s history.   Will you accept the results of December 21 if the pro-independence camp wins?,  he asked after supporters chanted  Puigdemont, our president  during a speech to unveil his list of candidates for the vote.  Do you commit to ending (direct rule) if that is the result?  said Puigdemont, the public face of the move for independence who is wanted in Spain for rebellion and sedition. After dissolving Catalonia s parliament and sacking theregional government in response to the region declaring itself independent on Oct. 27, Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoysaid a new election would be held in Catalonia and called onPuigdemont to take part. Pro-Catalonia independence parties are expected to win next month although they may fall short of a majority of seats in parliament needed to revive the secession campaign, polls show.  On December 21 we must tell Madrid, the EU and the tripartite support for direct rule that democracy in Catalonia must not be undermined. Never again in Catalonia!  Puigdemont said from the town of Oostkamp near Bruges, part of Belgium s Flemish region that has its own separatist aspirations. EU leaders are extremely wary of Catalonia s search for independence because it has stirred separatist feelings far beyond Spanish borders.  European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker this month in Madrid called on Europe to reject what he called separatist poison. A Belgian court has granted Puigdemont conditional release but he is barred from leaving Belgium without a judge s consent. \n",

      "1886) Hillary Clinton will be back in the spotlight this fall for an unprecedented, big-ticket book tour for her new tome What Happened, with tickets priced as high as $1,200.On Monday, the ex-Democratic nominee announced  Hillary Clinton Live,  a 15-city tour, which includes stops in a handful of states she lost in the election last year.The astronomically priced tickets for Hillary s loser tour, certainly begs the question:  If no one came to see Hillary at her rallies (for free) when she was running for president, why would they pay $1,200 to hear the even more irrelevant Hillary Clinton whine about why she lost to Trump? Promotional materials for her first stop, at the Warner Theatre in Washington, D.C., promises Clinton plans to  let loose  and tell her audience a  personal, raw, detailed and surprisingly funny story  of her election loss and recovery.The website promoting the tour, HillaryClintonBookTour.com, features a quote from Clinton too. In the past, for reasons I try to explain, I ve often felt I had to be careful in public, like I was up on a wire without a net,  she said.  Now I m letting my guard down,  she pledged. The tour kicks off on September 18 in D.C. and continues on all through fall.Clinton is making stops in the trio of states that are largely blamed for her election loss: Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Michigan.Clinton is hitting up a trio of Canadian cities too, making appearances in Toronto, Montreal and Vancouver.Top-tier ticket packages in those cities cost $3,000 Canadian dollars for two seats, or, in American dollars, about $1,200 a pop.

      "2034)  Prudence is thirty-four. She has had sex with twenty-one men and three women,  according an assignment for high schoolers in Scotland County, Missouri. After being celibate for three years, she meets Larry and a romance begins to develop. Larry is thirty-seven. One night he proposes that, things going the way he thinks they re going between them, they talk about their sexual histories. A concerned mother recently contacted Fox News columnist Todd Starnes about the assignment after her child received it in an English class at Scotland County R-1 Junior-Senior High School. Larry confesses to having slept with three women, one of whom he married. She tells him that she has slept with three men. Larry is uncomfortable with this number, especially since Prudence is younger than he is,  the assignment continued.  She amends it, saying that one was just heavy petting. Given Prudence s reflexive need for approval and Larry s clear ideas of how things should be, what percentage of the time will Prudence be inhibited in bed with Larry, and consequently fake orgasm to ease his pride? Here is a photo of the assignment: This is something I imagine you would see on a coffee table in every brothel,  the irate mother told Starnes.The unidentified woman said she contacted the school s principal, who provided a lame excuse for the assignment.

But he adds that, in his view, the ten pupils behaved badly. When worn by one pupil, this clothing is not insulting. But when ten pupils decide to wear it at the same time, they are trying to  send a message , says the headmaster. Via: 20min.com\n",

That is when Spicer, never to be henpecked by the MSM, fired back:  ABSOLUTELY JIM. I ll give you an example. Friday the president was having a great discussion at the G7 and someone from the BBC and then the New York times reTweeted that the President was being rude by disrespecting the Italian Prime Minister, when INFACT you all in every one of the meetings that you sit in watch the President with the one earpiece that has been used by other presidents. [ ] And that s the kind of thing that the BBC and then ultimately a reporter whose joining the New York Times push out and perpetuate with no apology! You re shaking your head Peter Peter Baker,  the White House Correspondent for Carlos Slim s Blog, the New York Times, apparently disagreed with the facts.Peter Baker,  the White House Correspondent for Carlos Slim s Blog, the New York Times, apparently disagreed with the facts.Sean:  It s true. You did it. That is when things got more heated, and more hilarious, exposing the true hypocrisy of the MSM when Peter asked Spicer,  Well don t reporters make mistakes? In that simple question, Peter Baker admitting that the BBC and NYT had lied to push an agenda, never apologized, and then tried to back track only after they were called out.Spicer was quick to confront that,  That s just FAKE! Jim tried budding back in, exposing probably the most MSM hypocrisy of the entire briefing: You re making something out of ONE TWEET! he objected.OH, YOU MEAN LIKE EVERY SINGLE BRIEFING WHERE 80% OF IT IS SPENT DISCUSSING TRUMP S TWEETS???After MSM reporters kept asking for a more examples so they could try and backtrack further, Spicer said,  I did not come with a list of things,  [click here for list of fake news stories] before going over the Administration s recent accomplishments and storming out before the reporters could further attempt to bicker with him.\n",
      "2076) He clarified that protesting in the United States is a right, but he also challenged the players taking a knee: If there s somewhere better, why don t you leave?Broncos defensive end Derek Wolfe explained Sunday why he stands for the national anthem, referencing the troops and the ideal vision of America. Wolfe, who is white, did not reference whether he agrees with the basis of the protest that gained steam Sunday following President Trump s condemnation: to object to the treatment of minorities in the United States.Entering Sunday, only one white player, Seth DeValve of Cleveland, had joined the movement. I stand because I respect the men who died in real battles so I have the freedom to battle on the field,  Wolfe, 27, told ESPN in a statement.  Paying tribute to the men and women who have given their lives for our freedom is why I stand. But everyone these days likes to find a reason to protest and that s their right. It s America and you are free to speak your mind. I just feel it s disrespectful to the ones who sacrificed their lives and it s the wrong platform. But like I said to each their own it s AMERICA! The greatest country in the world and if you don t think we are the greatest country in the world and you reside here, then why do you stay? A lot worse places in the world to call home. Proud to be an American. Several of his Broncos teammates took a kneel Sunday, days after Trump urged owners to kick the  son of a bitch  who protests off the team. Wolfe s teammate Brandon Marshall knelt throughout last season.Wolfe, in his sixth NFL season, grew up in Ohio and played at the University of Cincinnati. He skipped visiting the Obama White House following the Broncos  Super Bowl win in 2016, saying,  I just had a lot of stuff going on, things to do.   NYP\n",

      "2117) The bad news for these bleeding heart liberals is there are even more reasonably priced pizza shop options who understand economics and reality Image via Lanesplitter Pizza and Subs Facebook pageLiberals love the idea of the minimum wage and a  living wage at least until it hits their bottom line.Lanesplitter Pizza & Pub in Emeryville, California is learning that economics lesson the hard way.Cities up and down California have been considering hiking up their minimum wage so Vic Gumper, the owner of Lanesplitter, decided to get ahead of the curve and do it on his own.Rather than just raise the minimum wage for his employees, he decided to do it in the form of creating a  living wage pizza. This business model means that all workers now earn $15 to $25 an hour as part of an experimental business model that also did away with gratuities and raised prices, making meals at all five locations  sustainably served, really   no tips necessary,  the Los Angeles Times reported. This movement, it s going on everywhere,  Gumper told the paper.  We just decided to manage the situation and get to a place where we can sustain it. Image via Lanesplitter Pizza and Subs Facebook pageBut while patrons have applauded the move verbally, they haven t put their money where their mouth is.The  living wage pizza  costs more than $30 and people haven t been too keen on paying for it.Gumper has seen a 25% drop in sales since April and has had to eliminate lunch hours at a few of his locations, according to the L.A. Times. The necessity of paying people a living wage in the Bay Area is clear, so it s hard to argue against it, and it s something I m really proud to be able to try doing,  he said.  At the same time, I m terrified of going out of business after 18 years. Via: Red Alert Politics \n",

While he has proven to be a blustering sexist all on his own with comments made towards women like Megyn Kelly, Rosie O Donnell and fellow Republican Carly Fiorina, the press is helping him along as well.But, despite Trump s own damning antics, it s a recent expose in the New York Times appropriately titled  Crossing the Line: How Donald TrumpBehaved With Women in Private   that really dives deep below the surface into Trump s misogynistic harassment towards multiple women:The lengthy expose meticulously details multiple instances of inappropriate conduct with women, from models in the Miss America pageant, to employees in his Trump empire, and they re vivid memories of his disgusting behavior:The New York Times interviewed dozens of women who had worked with or for Mr. Trump over the past four decades, in the worlds of real estate, modeling and pageants; women who had dated him or interacted with him socially; and women and men who had closely observed his conduct since his adolescence. In all, more than 50 interviews were conducted over the course of six weeks.Their accounts   many relayed here in their own words   reveal unwelcome romantic advances, unending commentary on the female form, a shrewd reliance on ambitious women, and unsettling workplace conduct, according to the interviews, as well as court records and written recollections.Such instances include:The list goes on and on. From his early days at the military academy in the 1960s to his presidential campaign now, Trump has lived a life of debauchery, sexism, borderline pedophilia, cheating, manipulating and pure misogyny.And now he s the nominee for a major political party for President of the United States. I can only imagine how he would treat interns and White House staff.Featured image via Spencer Platt/Getty Images\n",

As the daughter of man born in Birmingham, Alabama, who rose against all odds to become one of the most established and respected doctor s at Yale University, there is no amount to money in the world that could buy my loyalty to a family that subscribed to such intolerant and bigoted ideologies.

      "2592) As Donald Trump continues to attack Mexicans, with his recent comments surrounding the Trump University lawsuit judge, Mexico s former president has one message for the GOP frontrunner: debate me.After chickening out of a debate with Bernie Sanders, Vicente Fox, who served as president of Mexico from 2000 to 2006, challenged the frontrunner to a televised encounter in San Cristobal, Mexico (with a free lunch included). In an interview on Rita Crosby s radio program  Election Central,  Fox said: I m willing to come here, to come here, to the States, if it s for a debate. A direct personal debate with him. Yes, we can use national broadcasting, public broadcasting. With you, we can do that debate. Fox then went on to jab Trump over his $10 million request for a debate, and said that a debate would be focused on ideas and not the overly sensationalist: One condition   that it s done in Mexico   because I need him to see what Mexico is all about, to see what we Mexicans are all about. He will change his attitude toward Mexico    would expect that he would listen to my arguments, that he would put his arguments on the table, but we both are obliged to document, to sustain with facts and numbers what we re saying, and not just lying or cheating to people. So, let s see if Trump will take his first opportunity at being  presidential  and have a cordial, factual conversation with a foreign leader. When he s not busy praising Putin or Jong-un, maybe he can take the time to actually listen to a real leader (one that doesn t rule with an authoritarian fist).But seeing how Trump is a chicken, and doesn t like to engage in a mature manner, the debate with Fox will be as likely as the one with Sanders. And of course Trump wouldn t dare take the bait, because once Fox proves that his people aren t what Trump paints them out to be, there goes his best talking point to his racist supporters.Featured image via Flickr\n",

Look out for lots of jabs and unfair tactics focusing on the two frontrunners. It s fine to ask questions but these liberal animals will hit below the belt. Watch for it  Why in the world is liberal journalist John Harwood moderating Wednesday s Republican debate? And where the heck is his conservative media partner? Wednesday night s debate will be hosted by CNBC at the University of Colorado in Boulder, Colorado. It will be moderated by Harwood along with CNBC s Carl Quintanilla and Becky Quick and is supposed to focus on economic issues, though previous CNBC debates have strayed far from that topic. Harwood frequently angers conservatives for his partisan takes on the news. I mostly laugh off his predictably liberal views because I don t take him that seriously. But that only leads us back to figuring out why he s moderating this Wednesday s debate. Let s just look at a few examples of how he covers news.

      "2688) BARCELONA - Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy urged Catalans to turn out in force in a December election to  restore normality  to a region buffeted by attempts to split from Spain. In his first visit to Barcelona since Madrid imposed direct rule on Catalonia and sacked its separatist leaders, Rajoy said the Dec. 21 election would safeguard the economy and stop companies moving out of the economically important region.  We want a massive turnout to begin a new political era of tranquillity, normality, coexistence and respect,  Rajoy told the Catalan wing of his conservative People s Party (PP).   We must urgently bring back normality to Catalonia ... to reduce social tension and stop damage to the economy.  Despite opposition to the early election imposed by Madrid as a way to resolve the impasse, the two leading pro-independence parties, PDeCAT of deposed leader Carles Puigdemont, and the ERC, have said they will participate.  However, they failed to agree to run on a united ticket, potentially harming the separatist camp s chances of winning a majority in the regional parliament.  The far-left pro-independence CUP party, whose support was key to Puigdemont s government, decided on Sunday to run in the upcoming election. Madrid s imposition of direct rule on Catalonia has widened a rift between political parties both in regional politics and at the municipal level.  On Sunday, the party of Barcelona Mayor Ada Colau voted to break its pact to govern with the Catalan Socialist Party (PSC), citing the latter s support for the application of direct rule. Some 54 percent of Spaniards evaluate positively Madrid s handling of the Catalan crisis, but only 28 percent of Catalans share this view, according to a poll for newspaper El Pais. On Saturday, 750,000 people marched in Barcelona to call for the release of separatist leaders from pre-trial detention. \n",

      "2720) Fox News host Megyn Kelly seemed to take a shot at Sean Hannity on Monday night after the much anticipated first presidential debate when she had to throw the live coverage to an interview between her colleague and Republican nominee Donald Trump.Hannity has been a prime target for just about everyone ever since Trump was formally nominated during the last night of the Republican National Convention in July. Former Daily Show host Jon Stewart got the ball rolling that night by torching Hannity for being a complete hypocrite when it comes to how he has covered President Obama in the past to how he treats Donald Trump now.Not long after that, Wall Street Journal foreign affairs columnist Bret Stephens called Hannity the  dumbest anchor on Fox News,  and the Washington Post followed up by calling Hannity out for lying about Trump coming to the rescue of U.S. Marines.Then CNN s Brian Stelter piled on by nailing Hannity for lying about Hillary Clinton, and Newsweek reporter Kurt Eichenwald slammed Hannity for claiming that Hillary suffers seizures.And now Hannity is getting shade from one of his own colleagues.During the post-debate analysis on Fox News, Kelly had to introduce Hannity s interview with Donald Trump. And as she introduced the interview, Kelly wondered if Trump would be talking to the actual journalists in the room afterward. We ve got Trump speaking to our own Sean Hannity. We ll see whether he speaks to the journalists in this room after that interview. Here s the video via YouTube.Trump and Hannity proceeded to trash Hillary Clinton, but it looks like the main focus will be on Kelly for basically telling a lying commentator like Hannity to go f*ck himself.And he definitely deserved the shade. After all, Hannity is not a real journalist. He ignores facts and peddles bullshit and frankly shouldn t be allowed anywhere near the airwaves. Hannity is Trump s puppet and he clearly cannot be fair and balanced as the network he works for advertises.Featured image via screen capture\n",

Those who mentor are able to build important leadership and management skills, while giving back to their community.There are 46 million young people, aged 8   18, living in America. 16 million of them are growing up without a mentor. That s one out of every three young people who, outside of their family at home, don t have a trusted adult who they believe they can turn to for advice and guidance.

      "2819) The leftist mainstream media would love Americans to believe Trump had Univision propagandist removed from the press conference. As anyone can clearly see, he had nothing to do with Ramos  removal and everything to do with him being invited back for a series of questions (with brilliant responses).Univision s Jorge Ramos was removed from Donald Trump s press conference this afternoon by security after standing up and delivering a sermon before Trump could even call on a reporter for a question. Even after the candidate called on another reporter in the room, Ramos continued his rapid fire question/political statement mix, talking over any chance the other reporter might have for a question, as can be seen in the video above. Excuse me. Sit down. You weren t called,  said Trump to the emotional anchor and reporter. You can t just stand up and scream,  said Trump. Amazing how waiting to be called on worked out.Other reporters in the room naturally asked Trump about the situation, and Trump defended what happened saying that Ramos simply stood up and started yelling, an accurate portrayal. Even so, Ramos was allowed to return to the press conference, was called on, and was able to ask several questions, as seen in this second video below. Via: Truth Revolt \n",

      "2878) Donald Trump recently gave a speech to the American Legion about the plans he has in mind for the children of America, and if he got his way it would affect every single one of them. But it would also break the law.Trump, playing to an audience with obvious military ties, brought up the idea of enforcing patriotism on children as part of the school curriculum.Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump signaled Thursday plans to seek nationwide changes to school curricula with the goal of  promoting American pride and patriotism in America s schools. In a Trump administration, I plan to work directly with the American Legion to uphold our common values and to help ensure they are taught to America s children,  Trump said, speaking at the American Legion s annual convention in Cincinnati.While the candidate argued that  We want our kids to learn the incredible achievements of America s history, its institutions and its heroes,  doing so from the presidency would, in fact, break the law.Military Times, in their coverage of Trump s remarks, points this fact out:The comments suggested a federal government intervention in the programs of locally run schools, which is prohibited under federal law.The comment is also ironic, as Trump has repeatedly claimed that he is opposed to Common Core because it supposedly imposes a top-down federal program in schools. In reality, the Common Core seeks to raise educational standards by rewarding local schools for improvements in their curriculum devised in the way they see fit, not as a top-down federal mandate.It is also unclear what brand of patriotism Trump would decide to enforce on American children. Throughout the campaign, he has advocated the idea that in his view certain races and faiths   particularly the Latino race and Muslim religion   are inferior and not worthy of Constitutional protections, when the actual Constitution makes no such distinctions. How could someone with that view seriously define patriotism for American children in all 50 states?Featured image via Flickr\n",

Seventy-eight percent of total respondents also chose  all lives matter,  including 81 percent of white and 76 percent of minority respondents, according to the poll.Black Lives Matter co-founder Julius Jones told CNN s Wolf Blitzer Tuesday that the notion that  all lives matter  is a  violent statement : And when people say  all lives matter,  it s actually a violent statement because the only time that people say  all lives matter  is in opposition to Black Lives Matter and it s the most violent statement of love that you can do,  he said incomprehensibly.Apparently the 64 percent of blacks who chose that violent statement didn t get Jones  memo.The Rasmussen poll surveyed 1,000 respondents and has a 3-point margin of error.Via: Truth Revolt\n",

In a Facebook post that may go down in the annals of history as one of her most horrifically stupid of all time (and there are a lot of them), the half-term, half-wit former Governor of Alaska attempted to woo Wisconsin voters in the most intelligent manner of which she is aware: with a picture of a dead animal.

      "2949) VATICAN CITY (Reuters) - If you ever wondered how to say  fake news  in Latin, it s  nuntii fallaces  - and Pope Francis is writing a document on just that. Francis announced it himself in a tweet to his nearly 40 million followers on Friday, saying the theme of his message for the Roman Catholic Church s next World Day of Social Communications will be  The truth will set you free. Fake news and journalism for peace.  In Latin, one of the nine languages the pope uses to tweet, that would be  Veritas liberavit vos. Nuntii fallaces et diurniariorum opus ad pacem.  A Vatican statement said the issue was important enough for the pope to address because  fake news contributes to generating and nurturing a strong polarisation of opinions.  A distortion of facts, it said, can have  repercussions at the level of individual and collective behaviour.  Francis said in an interview last year that media that focus on scandals and spread fake news to smear politicians risk becoming like people who have a morbid fascination with excrement. The Vatican statement said the leader of the 1.2 billion member Church wanted to offer  a reflection on the causes, the logic and the consequences of disinformation in the media, and helping to promote professional journalism, which always seeks the truth . The Church s next World Day of Social Communications will be celebrated on May 13. The pope s message will be released on January 24, feast of St Francis de Sales, the patron of journalists.

Senior administration officials on Thursday said that Trump was considering a plan to oust Tillerson, whose relationship with the president has been strained by the top U.S. diplomat’s softer line on North Korea and other policy differences, as well as by reports in October that he called the president a “moron.” Tillerson has not directly addressed whether he made the comment, though his spokeswoman denied it. The New York Times on Thursday first reported the White House plan to replace him. Asked to comment on some White House officials wanting him to resign, how the matter was being handled and what his plans were, Tillerson replied: “It’s laughable. It’s laughable.” His comments came as he posed for pictures with Libyan Prime Minister Fayez al-Sarraj of the United Nations-backed government in Tripoli. Tillerson visits Europe next week to attend NATO meetings in Brussels on Tuesday and Wednesday, an Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) meeting in Vienna on Thursday and talks with French officials in Paris on Friday. He is tentatively scheduled to meet Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov in Vienna on Thursday on the sidelines of the OSCE meeting, a senior State Department official told reporters. \n",

      "3129) One of America s most legendary journalists, Dan Rather, used his gift with words for a very special purpose on Wednesday: to blast Donald Trump and rally the press against the dangerous candidate.In a brilliant Facebook post, Rather urged his fellow journalists to keep holding Trump accountable and cornering the presumptive Republican nominee on the tough issues. Rather had felt an obligation to write the post after watching The Donald attack the press during a news conference on Tuesday. Rather said that when he watched Trump resort to bullying reporters to avoid questions about controversial issues like his suspicious donations to veterans  organizations, he  felt a shudder down my spine. The legendary newsroom wrote: This is a dirty, nasty election. And it is only going to get worse. The reporters in the trenches need no lecture from me. They are walking through daily minefields, bracing themselves against winds of discontent whose effects no one can predict. Rather is speaking from firsthand experience. In 1968, during the Democratic Convention, Rather worked through chaos and riots so that he could continue to question delegates and politicians. His tireless dedication resulted in this famous clip, which captures Rather getting punched in the stomach on national television:Noting that today s reporters are up against the same accusations of press bias and hostility that has followed American politics over the years, Rather noted that this particular election is different thanks to the brash business mogul. Rather singled out Trump for his air of  violence  and intimidation tactics that cause many press members to stay silent. To those who might be afraid of getting caught in Trump s line of fire, Rather reminds today s journalists that the  pen is still mightier than the sword  and that they should not  back up, back down, back away or turn around .

      "3272)  I am not a person who has sought the spotlight. That s the first stand-out sentence from the statement Jared Kushner released Monday morning in advance of his testimony before the Senate Intelligence Committee. We re willing to bet that line makes it into his daily mantra as he navigates the nightmare he s realizing he married into. Oh, I don t excuse Trump s son-in-law for his part in any of the current investigation/fiasco/shenanigans. Don t get me wrong. But his demeanor clearly indicates a man who is in a different category of prevaricator than the Trumps he now unfortunately finds himself wed to in more ways than just his nuptials with Ivanka.His statement, first reported by CNN (in full here), is an absolute masterwork of distancing himself from the crimes that were obviously committed. With so much of The Meeting  between Don Trump, Jr., Paul Manafort, and himself already out in public   so much already confirmed   there is little to do but work with what he s got.

      "3283) Because it was a  joke  before it was politically incorrect?Before Al Franken became a United States Senator from Minnesota, he had a long career as a comedian (save for Stuart Saves His Family), an original writer on Saturday Night Live, and later as a political radio host on Air America.During that time, and when he was writing books like Rush Limbaugh Is a Big Fat Liar and Lies and the Lying Liars Who Tell Them: A Fair and Balanced Look at the Right, Franken took some shots at his now-fellow senator John McCain s military service. He also made one joke in a 2000 Salon.com essay just as presidential election season started picking up steam. Here s the remark: I have tremendous respect for McCain but I don t buy the war hero thing. Anybody can be captured. I thought the idea was to capture them. As far as I m concerned he sat out the war.  Before everyone suggests Franken need to apologize just like Donald Trump should, here s why this is different: Back in 2000, Franken was not a political figure. He wasn t a sitting anything or a candidate for anything; the closest he came to political officialdom was as a revered satirist. More importantly, he even re-told the joke to McCain s face in 2004, when the senator was on Franken s own radio show.Here s how Franken s spokesperson commented on the joke:The fact that a statement came so quickly from Franken s office demonstrates that he is well-aware it is a terrible thing to say about McCain.On the other hand, Trump is not just not apologizing, he s doubling down. Because he knows we ll all keep writing about it.But hey   we all need a good clown, even if unintentional. It s a long presidential race. Via: Mediaite[h/t Politico]\n",
      "3285) Recently, the mainstream media (yes, including the  liberals ) fawned over President Trump s  presidential  address to a joint session of Congress. Why? Because he actually acted like a semi-decent human being. Instead of going off script on his usual childish tantrums and praise of himself, he stuck to the teleprompter and delivered a pretty forgettable speech.There was just one tiny thing that the mainstream media failed to notice: his speech was absolutely riddled with lies. And when we say riddled, we mean a significant chunk of the things he said in his hour speech were either misleading, factually incorrect, or flat out falsehoods.The Center for American Progress found that in the 61 minutes President Trump spoke, he lied 53 times. That s one lie almost every minute.Through an incredibly detailed spread sheet, CAP was able to identify every false statement and correct it for the record. It s pretty damning to see how often and easily the President of the United States can lie to the American people.Among President Trump s most egregious lies were:Everyone knows Trump lies and lies often. We ve known this since the campaign. We know that everything listed above can be easily disproved. The only reason Trump got high marks for his speech was 1) less people watched than the previous one, 2) more Republicans watched than independents and Democrats, and 3) he spoke  normally.  Besides that, it was typical Trump: an ill-informed demagogue who stokes fear by racially scapegoating Mexicans and blaming everything on President Obama.The media (and indeed the American electorate) cannot let President Trump get away with being a shameful liar simply because he talks in a polite voice and stays on script. America is better than to forgive this fascist after all he s done to this country and our standing in the world. Be vigilant.Featured image Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images\n",

      "3365) LIMA (Reuters) - Former authoritarian leader Alberto Fujimori sought forgiveness from Peruvians  from the bottom of my heart  on Tuesday for shortcomings during his rule, and thanked President Pedro Pablo Kuczynski for granting him a Christmas pardon. In a video on Facebook, Fujimori, 79, vowed that as a free man, he would support Kuczynski s call for reconciliation, hinting that he would not return to politics.  I m aware the results of my government were well received by some, but I acknowledge I also disappointed other compatriots,  the ailing Fujimori said, reading from notes while connected to tubes in a hospital bed.  And to them, I ask for forgiveness from the bottom of my heart.   The remarks were Fujimori s first explicit apology to the Andean nation that he governed with an iron fist from 1990-2000. They came after two days of unrest as protesters slammed the pardon as an insult to victims and part of a political deal to help Kuczynski survive a scandal. The pardon cleared Fujimori s convictions for graft and human rights crimes during his leadership of the rightwing government. Late on Monday, Kuczynski, a 79-year-old former Wall Street banker, appealed to Peruvians opposed to the pardon to  turn the page  and defended his decision as justified clemency for a sick man whose government helped the country progress.  I cannot keep from expressing my profound gratitude for the complex step that the president took, which commits me in this new stage of my life to decidedly support his call for reconciliation,  Fujimori said. \n",

The very first instance of an American presidential candidate in the modern age dropping the f-bomb during a stump speech occurred this week. And, naturally, it was Donald Trump who broke through the taboo then backed over it just to make sure it s dead.Indeed, Trump let fly with the f-word on Friday during one of his stream-of-consciousness rants that pass for stump speeches. And, frankly, I don t know whether to scowl or cheer. In spite of Trump s general awfulness, I m leaning  cheer. We re gonna bring businesses back.

We can t say it on non-pay cable or on the radio   or on websites because advertisers don t like it   but we can show unspeakable scenes of violence and other horrors all the time. There s something perverse and unjust about that. So, in that regard, Trump can feel free to let the expletives fly. But if he s elected, I wonder if his FCC appointees will be equally lenient. On the other hand, Trump s use of  f*ck  is another step away from presidential decorum on the Republican side, and one step closer to amateur-hour composed of reality show hacks running for the highest office in the land. I m honestly torn.For the record, Trump has said  f*ck  in public before, but not during a presidential stump speech.Featured image via video screen grab.\n",

From my understanding SACC disbanded because they realized the makeup and tactics of their group was at odds with their espoused principles,  Swarthmore Conservative Society President Gilbert Guerra told Campus Reform.  Their main support base was middle-upper class white kids who enjoy jogging. The farewell letter corroborates Guerra s understanding, asserting that  SACC s fundamental failure  was that  at its formation, it was made up of entirely white, with the exception of one person of color*, students,  and to make matters worse,  not one of [the founding members] are from low-income and/or working class backgrounds. Arguing that  low-income people of color should never be an afterthought in a group whose politics supposedly focus on their liberation,  the author then went on to accuse SACC of having a  history of abuse, racism, and even classism that was never adequately addressed or recognized despite constantly being brought up as an issue.

Isn t that giving the questions away?I d call that a strategy session because we shouldn t forget that Ben Rhodes and David Rhodes are brothers This Saturday s second Democratic debate will be a much smaller affair than the first. With only three candidates on stage, CBS News plans to delve deep into the issues with each candidate and have taken advantage of the smaller pool by doing some intense research. Moderator John Dickerson and his team met with each of the campaigns for more than an hour to discuss the major issues at play in the race, sources on the campaigns said, describing the pre-interview as  informational in nature.  Dickerson is not giving candidates previews of his questions for the debate. Prior to the CNN debate, the campaigns said moderator Anderson Cooper did not reach out directly to them before the candidates took the stage.  Dickerson and his team were very interested in getting to better know the senator s stand on a wide spectrum of issues, what he would do about income inequality in this country,  said Bernie Sanders  spokesman Michael Briggs. He said they discussed issues where there are real differences between the candidates   including gun control, the death penalty and raising taxes on the middle class.  John Dickerson s a smart, impressive guy who cares a lot about the issues,  Briggs said.  I m sure we ll see a smart, issues-oriented debate. Read more: politico\n",

      "3921) Trump has been tweeting about Hurricane Irma sort of for the last couple of days. His tweets mostly consist of bragging that his emergency teams are ready and telling people to stay safe. But while he s pretending to be concerned, he s also sending out messages begging people for donations; not to the charities and rescue organizations that are, and will be, on the ground in Florida during and after Irma, but to himself and his 2020 campaign.He s not even making a pretense of asking for donations to help him help those in Irma s path. Seriously. This is what he s sending out to his followers:The link in the above image goes to the donation page on Trump s campaign site, where a video again attacks career politicians and the media, and goes into his usual spiel about  Let s finish the job,  and  Make America great again.  It s ridiculously tone-deaf in light of how many are scrambling to aid those in Irma s path.He bragged about his response to the devastation of Hurricane Harvey, but he s not really doing anything but tweeting about Irma and closing Mar-a-Lago ahead of landfall. He s made a Facebook video that, like his tweets, urges people to get out of Irma s way, but many don t have that choice.The federal government has three major relief efforts to deal with right now: Ongoing recovery efforts in Texas and Louisiana, live-saving efforts in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands (where Irma has already hit), and evacuation and preparation efforts in Florida, which is more or less closed and in chaos.Trump will  monitor  Irma from the safety of Camp David and beg for donations to his campaign instead of do some real work.His timing for this kind of a message is especially poor. If he wants to ask for donations, fine. But he should be directing people to donate to the non-profits and other organizations that are on the ground everywhere in Irma s path and put his stupid, vapid campaign on hold. His priorities are clear, and they do not lie with the American people.Featured image via Win McNamee/Getty Images\n",

      "3929) SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Singapore authorities charged human rights activist Jolovan Wham on Wednesday for organizing public assemblies without a police permit, prompting rights groups to call on the government to guarantee the right to peaceful assembly. The 37-year-old Wham, the former executive director of a group advocating the rights of foreign workers in Singapore, could be fined up to $10,000 or imprisoned for up to 6 months, or both, if found guilty of repeat offences. Wham was involved in a protest in June by several blindfolded activists who held up books on a subway train in a call for justice for 22 people detained in 1987 under a tough internal security law.  Wham is recalcitrant and has repeatedly shown blatant disregard for the law, especially with regard to organizing or participating in illegal public assemblies , Singapore Police Force said in a statement.   He was also charged for vandalism and refusing to sign statements made during investigations, the police said. He faces a total of seven charges stemming from public assemblies he organized dating back to November 2016, the police said. Under strict public assembly laws, protests are allowed only at a designated downtown square called the Speakers  Corner. Human Rights Watch on Wednesday called on Singapore to drop the case against  peaceful protestor  Wham and to amend what it called a  draconian  law on public order to guarantee Singaporeans the right to peaceful assembly.   Prosecuting Jolovan Wham for holding peaceful gatherings demonstrates the absurdity of Singapore s laws on public assemblies and the government s willingness to penalize those who speak out,  its deputy Asia director Phil Robertson said.  The Singapore government should start listening to criticism, stop treating peaceful assemblies as crimes, and cease prosecuting their organizers,  he said. A pre-trial conference for the case will take place on Dec. 13. \n",

Touching on a variety of political issues such as gun violence, addiction awareness, the Syrian refugee crisis, racial injustice and education, last night s speech definitely lived up to all of the president s previous State of The Union addresses and was possibly even greater.As we ve come to live in such a digitally connected society, it should come as no surprise that the internet started to respond immediately to Obama s final SOTU broadcast. As millions of Americans watched Obama, Twitter worked overtime to churn out a seemingly endless number of hilarious, quick-witted memes, capturing some of the most notable and comical moments of the event s guests and members of Congress. No one was spared   if you ended up on camera, you were pretty much instantly made into an internet meme.

      "4054) In a stunning reversal, Donald Trump said that he will strengthen the rights of the LGBT community and bring people together. His new stance comes just days after he said that as president, he would   strongly consider  overturning Obergefell vs Hodges, the Supreme Court decision that found that same-sex couples have a legal and constitutional right to marry. I m a lesbian, we ve had some great progress for the gay and lesbian community,  NECN reporter  Sue O Connell told Trump. When President Trump is in office, can we look for more forward motion on equality for gays and lesbians?  Here is Trump s response: Well, you can. We re going to bring people together, and that s your thing, and other people have their thing. We have to bring all people together and if we don t we re not going to have a country anymore. Now that s one big flip-flop because in addition to Trump saying he would appoint judges to overturn Obergefell vs Hodges, he has stated in the past  time and time again that he only supports marriage between a man and a woman. He has said: I m not in favor of gay marriage. I don t feel right about marriage equality. Trump has even gone as far as to compare same-sex relationships to choosing the wrong kind of golf putter! He said:  It s like in golf. A lot of people   I don t want this to sound trivial   but a lot of people are switching to these really long putters, very unattractive. It s weird. You see these great players with these really long putters, because they can t sink three-footers anymore. And, I hate it. I am a traditionalist. I have so many fabulous friends who happen to be gay, but I am a traditionalist. In trying to rationalize the irrational, it s most likely that Trump is pandering to New Hampshire voters for the primary, 67% of whom support gay marriage. Whatever his reasoning, his  new position is going to upset his bigoted right-wing conservative following.Featured image via video screen capture \n",

But it wasn t easy, was it, Mr. Ryan?CBS correspondent Nancy Cordes asked Speaker Ryan if he still has  full confidence in Donald Trump.  This is an easy question for the meth-addled morons who still hang on every word spoken by their favorite fascist, but Ryan (like many Republicans who want to be re-elected) seemed to have difficulty with the question. He simply looked down, a  get me the f*ck out of here  expression overtaking his rodent-like face.In recent days, we learned that Donald Trump handed state secrets directly to Russia in the Oval Office, and that James Comey s firing occurred after he refused to pledge his loyalty to Trump and requested additional resources for his investigation into The Donald s collusion with Russia. At this point, if anyone has anything approaching faith in Donald Trump, they are unfit to serve in any elected office.Ryan could have provided a one-word answer to that question if he truly believed in The Donald.

This ought to make her even more of a rock star among liberals:When taking the oath of office, Cruz delayed repeating the words that she would  uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States,  turning her back to the woman administering the oath for a long moment.  After turning her back and pausing, Cruz does swear to defend the Constitution, and then enthusiastically repeats to uphold the Puerto Rican Constitution.Her approval rating was as low as 24% earlier this year.

Now that we know Indiana Gov. Mike Pence is Donald Trump s pick, we re now left to sift through clues to figure out who Hillary Clinton will give the nod too.Well, one huge clue was given when Elizabeth Warren showed up at Hillary Clinton s Washington D.C. home today, but an ever bigger clue has come as Warren s name appears to no longer be on the speaking schedule for the Democratic National Convention.Originally slotted to speak as the keynote speaker on Monday night of the convention, Warren s name is now missing.According to Politico, this is the schedule as it stands now:Monday:  First Lady Michelle Obama, Senator Bernie Sanders and DREAMer Astrid Silva Gavel time expected at 3:00 p.m.Tuesday:  President Bill Clinton Gavel time expected at 4:00 p.m.Also scheduled Tuesday are Mothers of the Movement members Gwen Carr, Mother of Eric Garner; Sybrina Fulton, Mother of Trayvon Martin; Maria Hamilton, Mother of Dontr  Hamilton; Lucia McBath, Mother of Jordan Davis; Lezley McSpadden, Mother of Michael Brown; Cleopatra Pendleton-Cowley, Mother of Hadiya Pendleton; Geneva Reed-Veal, Mother of Sandra Bland.Wednesday:  President Barack Obama and Vice President Joe Biden Gavel time expected at 4:30 p.m.Thursday:  Hillary Clinton and Chelsea Clinton Gavel time expected at 4:30 p.m.Very interesting indeed.Noticeably also missing are other members on Clinton s shortlist for vice president, such as Sherrod Brown and Tim Kaine, but seeing as Warren was scheduled to speak, and now isn t, it could be very, very telling.Now that Trump has rounded out his ticket with Mike Pence, a man who represents the only group Trump has yet to openly hate   the LGBT community   it s looking pretty good for Clinton come November, and hopefully whoever she picks as her VP will round out the ticket nicely.Featured image via Jessica Kourkounis/Getty Images\n",

      "4376) WITTENBERG, Germany (Reuters) - Invoking the spirit of the Reformation, Chancellor Angela Merkel called for religious freedom and tolerance on Tuesday and said Germany should lend extra support to the children of refugees  who have experienced awful things.   We have learned that tolerance is the soul of Europe,  she said at a ceremony on the 500th anniversary of the reformation in Wittenberg, where Martin Luther is said to have nailed his theses challenging Catholicism to a church door. Luther argued against what he saw as abusive practices by Catholic preachers, though the reformation divided western Christianity and resulted in violence, persecution and discrimination. Merkel, the daughter of a protestant pastor, praised Luther s translation of the Bible into a standard form of written German, which she said made its teachings accessible to the population at large.  Religious education was a fundamental concern of the reformation,  she said, stressing the importance of education for everyone.  To learn and develop skills, some children need to be given more support than others - for example when parental support is lacking. This applies too to integrating children from refugee families who have experienced and undergone awful things.  Merkel has come under fire for allowing more than one million migrants to enter Germany over the past two years - a decision that saw her conservatives bleed support to the anti-immigration Alternative for Germany (AfD) party in a national election last month. People from different backgrounds often knew too little about each other, she said, stressing the importance of dialogue between religions.  Just as the freedom of belief always has to be protected from religious fanaticism, so freedom of worship, on the other hand, requires that religion be protected from contempt,  Merkel added. To honor the 500th anniversary, Reformation Day was a public holiday in Germany this year. \n",

      "4396)  (Editor’s note: This story contains language in the second paragraph that may offend readers) BOSTON (Reuters) - Maine legislative leaders are set to meet on Thursday to discuss whether to push for the resignation of Governor Paul LePage, a week after he left an obscenity-laden voicemail for a lawmaker who had criticized him for making racially charged comments. The meeting comes a day after LePage, a Republican who earlier in the week discussed the possibility of not finishing his term in a radio interview, said he would seek “spiritual counseling” but not resign after calling Democratic State Representative Drew Gattine a “little son-of-a-bitch, socialist cocksucker.” The Democratic speaker of the Maine House, Mark Eves, and the Republican president of Maine Senate, Michael Thibodeau, will be attending the 4 p.m. EDT (2000 GMT) meeting, according to their representatives, as will several lower-ranking members of the legislative leadership. The state House and Senate both adjourned in April, so the leaders would need to agree on the need for a special session before setting any votes calling for LePage’s resignation or censure. Earlier this year a group of lawmakers started an effort to impeach him, contending the governor overstepped his authority by threatening to withhold funds from a nonprofit group that hired a political rival, but that effort collapsed before making it to the full House. LePage has been in the national spotlight for making repeated statements blaming out-of-state black and Hispanic people for the heroin trade in Maine. He has rejected any allegations of racism, saying his sole concern is saving lives in the state. The two-term governor, whose current term extends through 2018, has apologized for the language he used in the voicemail. Gattine has joined the chorus of lawmakers calling for LePage to step down. The minority Republican leadership of the House have backed LePage, saying they accept his apology and want to move on. \n",

      "4420) FRANKFURT (Reuters) - French President Emmanuel Macron said on Tuesday he is determined to engage Germany in a debate that he wants to push forward on European reforms, despite a cool initial response from Chancellor Angela Merkel.  I believe that, if you have a vision, you shouldn t go to the doctor but you should open a debate,  Macron said in Frankfurt, where he was due to meet Merkel and attend the opening of an annual book fair. Macron s visit is his first to Germany since Merkel narrowly won an election last month, losing votes to a far-right party that drew support from people angered by an influx of more than a million migrants over the past two years. The 39-year-old French president, in a speech two days after the German vote, set out an ambitious vision for Europe, calling for tighter cooperation on defense and immigration, and for a common euro zone budget. Merkel, still to begin what promise to be difficult talks on building a new coalition government, has cautioned that reforming the euro zone should not be the top priority and the debate should be more inclusive. Macron was taking part in a panel discussion at Frankfurt s Goethe University with Daniel Cohn-Bendit, the Green politician best known for his role in the Paris student protests of 1968, and Gilles Kepel, a political scientist and expert on the Middle East. \n",

      "4518) Here s a nice little factoid for you: out of all the candidates running for president this year, only one actually pays their interns. Can you take a guess as to who that one person might be? It s none other than your favorite democratic socialist, Senator Bernie Sanders.You heard that right: No one else, not Donald Trump, not even Hillary Clinton, pay their interns, not in a house, not in a tree, not anywhere (to borrow a line from Dr. Suess).The Washington Post ran an unofficial investigation from the angle of how  Presidential candidates ignore the costs of unpaid internships  despite their rhetoric to the contrary. It s particularly fitting considering they talk a big game about the  eroding middle class and rising social inequality,  yet they treat their own workers like slaves.Even the leading Republican candidates talk about income inequality openly, even though they may not get as much press coverage on the topic, yet still, somehow Jeb Bush, Marco Rubio, Ben Carson, Ted Cruz, and Donald Trump don t care enough to pay their interns. Not Bernie Sanders, though. He pays his interns $10.10 an hour. Not too shabby!While we will admit this is nowhere close to the $15.00 an hour Bernie advocates for on the campaign trail, it s far and above anything else the other candidates are offering.If you believe in a higher minimum wage, this should be important to you. If you think workers need to be treated with respect, this difference between the candidates should be important to you. What better predictor is there for how a candidate is going to conduct themselves in office than how they conduct their own campaign?Featured image via Flickr\n",

      "4973) BERLIN (Reuters) - The premier of Germany s most populous state has become the most senior member of Chancellor Angela Merkel s conservative bloc to throw his weight behind French President Emmanuel Macron s proposals for deepening and reforming the European Union. In an article for Thursday s Frankfurter Allgemeine newspaper, Armin Laschet, premier of North Rhine-Westphalia, embraced proposals for a common European army, intelligence service and, in the long term, a common finance minister. The proposals could offer a basis for cooperation with the Social Democrats (SPD), who vote on Thursday on whether to enter talks on supporting a new conservative-led government. SPD leader Martin Schulz, a former European Parliament president, is an outspoken advocate of closer European integration.  In a time of  eurosclerosis , with (eurosceptic) populists inside Europe and instability on the periphery, Macron wants to work with us to overcome the crisis,  wrote Laschet, his party s vice-president.  Europe s crisis, forced by Brexit, offers the chance at last to confront the challenges.  Merkel and most of her party colleagues have been more cautious in their reception of Macron s reform proposals, which include closer cooperation on defense, migration and a deeper integration of the euro currency zone. He was less specific in addressing Macron s proposals for changing the euro zone s governance mechanisms, saying only:  We need better conditions for investment, and we need harmonization of corporation tax.  Schulz has said that the SPD, reluctant to repeat the bruising experience of being deserted by voters after governing for four years with Merkel in coalition, will discuss Macron s proposals at its three-day party congress starting on Thursday.  What are our possibilities, our options, our instruments for ensuring that Germany embraces these French ideas?  Schulz asked earlier on Wednesday.  France is making proposals and Germany is not engaging. This is not acceptable.  \n",

      "4996) TEL AVIV (Reuters) - Thousands of Israelis protested in Tel Aviv on Saturday for the second consecutive week against government corruption and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who is under criminal investigation over allegations of abuse of office. Police estimated the number of demonstrators at about 10,000 and they followed last Saturday s demonstration, which was by far the largest of the recent weekly anti-corruption protests when an estimated 20,000 people participated. The protests have been sparked by corruption allegations against Netanyahu, who denies any wrongdoing. The four-term leader is suspected of involvement in two cases.  The first involves receiving gifts from wealthy businessmen and the second involves negotiating a deal with a newspaper owner for better coverage in return for curbs on a rival daily. If charged, he would come under heavy pressure to resign or could call an election to test whether he still had a mandate to govern. Netanyahu s right-wing Likud party said in a Facebook post that the protest was a left-wing demonstration. It called on all Israelis to back their prime minister as he defends Israel against international criticism following U.S. President Donald Trump s acceptance of Jerusalem as Israel s capital.  Instead of uniting with all the people behind Jerusalem and showing the world a unified front, the left cannot contain itself and it prefers to create division,  part of the statement said. Over weeks of demonstrations, protesters have identified themselves as supporting both left- and right-wing parties. On Saturday they held banners reading:  Neither left, nor right (we demand) integrity,   We are fed up with corrupt (politicians)  and  Sweep the corrupt away.  \n",

It s almost obscene how both sides are unable to get along and work together to get the job they were elected to do done.Clearly noticing how childlike both Republicans and Democrats are behaving, The Daily Show put together a correspondent s piece featuring a play-at-home game for children depicting what it s really like within the walls of Congress trying to get anything done.The segment features children reading a giant rule book and trying to understand the rules, but then it shows one player not wanting to follow any of the rules in favor of how they want to play the game. That one side likely being an example of Republicans who lately have made it impossible to get anything done, including using their own interpretation of the Constitution on when and how Supreme Court Justices should be confirmed.By the end of the segment it shows one child utterly frustrated with the other kid s absolute inability to play the game by the rules, so they both end up giving up. This unfortunately is all too accurate of a depiction of the way the real United States Congress has been working lately. That s why it s VERY important to make sure we re voting the right people into Congress and not just focusing on who s in the White House, but rather in every branch of government.All in all, The Daily Show absolutely nailed the reality of Congress.

      "5083) BERLIN (Reuters) - Chancellor Angela Merkel s Bavarian allies still hope a three-way coalition government can be formed by the end of the year even though negotiators made little progress on bridging deep divisions this week, a senior party official said on Friday. Merkel is trying to unite her conservative alliance, which consists of her CDU and its Bavarian CSU sister party, in a pact with the Greens and the pro-business Free Democrats to form a government. The conservatives placed first but lost seats in an election last month. After meeting for 11 hours on Thursday, the three camps resigned themselves to further talks next week after making little headway on the contentious issues of immigration and climate policy.  Our aim is for the exploratory talks to be at the stage in mid-November where we can tell our (party) committees  yes, this works, let us begin concrete negotiations ,  said Manfred Weber, a senior member of the CSU who is involved in the talks.  And then I hope we will have a new government by the end of the year,  he told broadcaster Bayerischer Rundfunk, but added:  It will be very difficult.  Immigration was the most divisive topic on Thursday. Many conservatives want to take a harder line after blaming their election setback on Merkel s decision to open Germany to more than a million mainly Middle Eastern migrants in 2015 and 2016. Negotiators will meet again next Monday and Thursday, by which time they want to seek a solution on refugee policy, sources close to the talks said. An agreement reached between Merkel s CDU and the CSU to cap annual refugee numbers had to be the basis of any coalition accord, Andreas Scheuer, CSU general secretary, said after Thursday s talks. The Greens oppose a refugee cap. Politicians say it could take months to form the coalition, leaving Germany hobbled as the European Union looks to its wealthiest country for leadership on governance reform. \n",

      "5265) BERLIN (Reuters) - Christian Lindner, leader of Germany s pro-business Free Democratic Party (FDP), distanced himself from a possible three-way coalition with Chancellor Angela Merkel s conservatives and the pro-environment Greens after the Sept. 24 election. Lindner told German magazine Focus in an interview published Friday that he saw big hurdles to reaching agreement with the Greens on immigration and energy policies, reducing the prospects for a so-called Jamaica coalition of the conservatives, Greens and the FDP.   In the meantime, I can t imagine a Jamaica coalition,  Lindner told the magazine.  Merkel s conservatives were at 37 percent in the latest Infratest dimap poll, versus 21 percent for the Social Democrats (SPD), their lowest reading since early January. The anti-immigration, euro-hostile AfD came in unchanged at 11 percent, making it the third-strongest political force, followed by the radical Left party with 10 percent and the FDP at 9 percent, while the Greens scored 8 percent. The fractured political landscape could make it hard to form a viable alliance other than the current grand coalition between Merkel s CDU/CSU and the SPD.  Political experts say they are skeptical that the other possible option - the Jamaica coalition - could work, given significant differences between the parties and the fact that such an alliance has never been tested on the federal level. Lindner s comments to the magazine underscored the problems facing such a coalition.  Meanwhile, Sahra Wagenknecht, head of the radical Left party, signaled her willingness to compromise with the SPD to permit the possibility of a so-called  red, red, green  coalition among the SPD, Left and Greens.  Of course there can be compromises,  Wagenknecht told the RND chain of newspapers, citing labor law and inheritance taxes as possible areas where the Left party would be willing to make concessions. \n",

      "5295) VIENNA (Reuters) - Austria s conservative People s Party wants children who do not speak  sufficient  German to take compulsory language classes as a condition for being allowed to attend school, party leader Sebastian Kurz said on Wednesday.  Tens of thousands of migrants from the Middle East, Afghanistan and Africa have arrived in Austria in the past two years. Their integration has become an important political topic and Kurz, whose party is the junior partner in a coalition government with the Social Democrats, has gained in popularity because of his hard stance on immigration. Though his proposal ostensibly applies to all children, public debate has centered around those from migrant backgrounds, most of whom are currently placed at school according to age.  They receive separate language lessons but teachers have said that this is not enough to integrate them.  One can only follow the curriculum if one s German is good enough,  Kurz said at a news conference in Salzburg, where he presented his party s education program for parliamentary elections on Oct. 15.  Who starts at school needs to understand the teaching language,  the party chief said, echoing demands from the far-right Freedom Party.  \n",
      "5332) Joy Villa, the singer who became an overnight sensation when she bravely wore a  Make America Great Again  pro-Trump dress to the Grammy s designed by Andre Soriano, a proud Trump supporter and gay legal immigrant from the Philippines, was the headline speaker at a  March 4 Trump  rally in Wisconsin. Villa thanked the crowd for supporting her after she shocked the nation in by bravely showing her support for Trump in a place where her views are not only shunned, but can be the kiss of death for an entertainer. Villa then went on to make a powerful speech to the pro-Trump attendees about love and unity and finally ended on a high note by asking everyone to join her in singing,  God Bless America. Here s a short excerpt from her powerful speech: Every one of your voices are not being heard. We are no longer the silent minority. We re not gonna be silent anymore. We are not gonna be bullied. We are not gonna be spit on. We re not gonna be told we can t support our president, because he is no longer campaigning. He is elected. We are a peaceful protest. We re not being rude. We re not hating people. W ere not hurting anyone. We re just joining together .being beautiful and being unified. And that s what this country is about. We are unified.
