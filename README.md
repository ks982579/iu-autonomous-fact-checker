## Abstract

> Light description here.

Building an AI model to help users determine if claims are true or false.

## Licensing

I am not a super familiar with all the different types of licenses.
However, I found [this link](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/) provided when creating the repository that explains the ones available on Github.
Not sure if it is new, I've never noticed it since creating the previous ~40 repositories, or I did notice it and forgot the link.
Either way, it is a gem; clearly explains and summarizes main points.

I went with the GNU GPLv3 license because it makes this work available to eveyone, it's free and open.
Users can freely run, study, share, and modify the software as they like.
Companies can even use the software for commercial use!
However, it has 'anti-proprietary' protection - companies cannot hijack the code and make it proprietary.
Any _distributed_ software produced by this software must also be distributed with the **same** license.

That last statement might be off-putting for some companies or small businesses.
If you try to integrate this software into your system and distribute the system, you'd have to release the system under this copyleft license.
Since this project is focused on finding the truth, and rooting out the lies, I believe transparency is crucial.
What I do recommend if the project ever takes off,
and for companies concerned about the license,
is to incorporating this tool as a microservice.
The GLP requirements are triggered by distribution - using the software as a standalone service won't require opening your entire system.
Keep the microservice open for transparency and use it as a standalone service.

If there are any issues with the license, please feel free to reach out and I will consider changes.
